First of all, we need to create a file, and i call it 'program.c' and open this up, we write our little 'int main' , we've got memory corruption what does that mean? well it means we got memory firstt and foremost before we can have memory corruption. How do we get some memory in C? lets create just a little buffer and we'll say this buffer can hold 100 bytes:

```
int main()
{
    char buffer[100];
}
```
